   <p><b>African countries</b> need to build transformative, good governance and democratic institutions. 
    A crucial component of such institutions is strong leadership. Leadership in the developmental State aims
     at defining an agenda that meets the needs of the people and puts national interests above personal interests.
     Governments can improve the quality of life in their countries by offering affordable and accessible healthcare, 
     investing in education at the primary and secondary level, providing affordable housing,
      offering family-friendly policies, and putting laws into place for workers to earn liveable wages.
      Access to services is essential to improving quality of life. Better health, education, water and sanitation services are the key to creating a healthy
       and educated population that is equipped to take advantage of work and business opportunities.</p>

    Countries may be classified as either developed or developing based on the gross domestic product (GDP) or gross national income (GNI) per capita, the level of industrialization, 
    the general standard of living, and the amount of technological infrastructure, among several other potential factors, but<b> Africa </b>is the least-developed continent outside of Antarctica, 
    with many of its countries still mired in issues including poverty, government corruption, and armed conflict</p>
