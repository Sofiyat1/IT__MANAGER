<p><b>AFRICANS</b>
as a whole...<br>
We contribute to the development of Africa, <br>and hereby ready to participate in some proccesses<br>
that can lead to the prosperity of Africa at large </p>
<br>
<h2>Population Issues</h2>
<p>There should be certain years interval, when Population census will be carried out to know the population of a particular country, 
in order to ensure stability in the number of people present in a geographical area at a point in time. This process will reduce insecurity in the country.<br>
For any Country to be developed, security is needed most and it is the head for the other steps that should be taken. Africa citizens must be ensure of safety first,
before any other thing could be put in place. Africa should be developed for the conveniency of everybody and to do this, there must be unity within everyone of us.
We all can also be determined to contribute to the development of Africa at large, let alone each person's country.</p>

<p>As <b>Africa's</b> population looks set to quadruple over the twenty-first century, The Telegraph digs into the data to reveal the opportunities - 
and challenges - facing a fast-changing continent Africa's population is booming. By 2100, it will be home to 4.4 billion people - four times its current population.
Such an increase - far larger than the global population increase of 53 per cent by 2100 - will pose significant challenges. Poverty, conflict, disease and access to 
education are all issues African governments will continue to face, having to build states that can support ever-increasing amounts of people.
By 2050, more than half of Africa's 2.2bn people will live in its rapidly expanding cities. That's the equivalent of the population of China.

The UN has counted 71 African cities with a population higher than 750,000, many of which lack the infrastructure to support large populations. These cities are growing at an unstoppable pace - expected to hold 100m more people in 2025 than they did in 2010.

Just as governments will have to cope with higher populations, greater levels of urbanisation will also challenge countries as they seek to develop.
The UN has warned: "The continent continues to suffer under very rapid urban growth accompanied by massive urban poverty and many other social problems.

"These seem to indicate that the development trajectories followed by African nations since post-independence may not be able to deliver on the aspirations of broad based human development and prosperity for all."
The continent began to take off in the second half of the twentieth century, with its population almost quadrupling in 50 years. Eastern and Central Africa, including countries such as Kenya and the Congo, had the highest population growth. Meanwhile, those in the south and north - such as South Africa and Tunisia - saw less growth. This trend is expected to continue in this century - but so far, population growth has not equated to prosperity.

While there are flaws in data collection and publication processes in Africa, which is itself a hindrance to development, figures still reveal how Africaâ€™s increasingly large and urban population will affect people's lives.
